### Instructions ###
1. Create two buttons inside the div with buttons id, labeled OK and Cancel (like the image "complete.png") using Javascript. Your CSS is all done for you.
1. If the user "Lawnmower Man" enters "7.3942" as the password and clicks "OK", delete the entire div class box and show http://i.imgur.com/IUVDNyp.jpg.
1. If the password is NOT "7.3942" with username "Lawnmower Man" and the user clicks "OK", make the background color of the body div red and clear the user name and password inputs.
1. If the user clicks "Cancel", clear the user name and password inputs.
